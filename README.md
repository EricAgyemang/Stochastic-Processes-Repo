# STOCHASTIC PROCESS REPOSITORY
A stokhazesthai (stochastic) process, also called a random process, is one in which outcomes are uncertain  (MAT 455, ISU). 

In its most general expression, a stochastic process is simply a collection of random variables *{X<sub>t</sup>, t ∈ I}*. The index t often represents time, 
and the set *I* is the index set of the process. The most common index sets are *I = {0, 1, 2,…}*, representing discrete time, and *I = [0, ∞)*, representing
continuous time. Discrete-time stochastic processes are sequences of random variables. Continuous-time processes are uncountable collections of random variables.
The random variables of a stochastic process take values in a common state space *S*, either discrete or continuous. A stochastic process is specified by
its index and state spaces, and by the dependency relations among its random
variables.

# STOCHASTIC MODEL
The word “stochastic” comes from the Greek stokhazesthai, which means to aim at, or guess at. A stochastic process, also called a
random process, is simply one in which outcomes are uncertain. By contrast, in a deterministic system there is no randomness. In a 
deterministic system, the same output is always produced from a given input.


# DYNAMICS OF STOCHASTIC PROCESS
The dynamics of a stochastic process are described by random variables and probability distributions. In the deterministic growth model, one 
can say with certainty how many bacteria are present after t minutes.

       
    NOTE:
        For the stochastic model, questions of interest might include:
        • What is the average number of bacteria present at time t?
        • What is the probability that the number of bacteria will exceed some threshold after t minutes?
        • What is the distribution of the time it takes for the number of bacteria to double in size?
        
        
# POISSON PROCESS
A Poisson process is a special type of counting process. Given a stream of events that arrive at random times starting at *t = 0*, let Nt denote 
the number of arrivals that occur by time *t*, that is, the number of events in *[0, t]*. For instance, Nt might be the number of text messages received 
up to time *t*. For each *t ≥ 0*, *N<sub>t</sup>* is a random variable. The collection of random variables *(*N<sub>t</sup>*)t≥0* is a continuous-time, integer-valued stochastic process, called a counting process. Since *N<sub>t</sup>* counts events in *[0, t]*, as t increases, the number of events Nt increases.
